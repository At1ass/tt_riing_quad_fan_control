# TT Riing Quad Fan Control

**TT Riing Quad Fan Control** is an experimental fan control application designed for Thermaltake Riing Quad controllers. The application monitors CPU and Nvidia GPU temperatures to adjust fan speeds dynamically, providing an adaptive cooling solution for your system.

## Overview

This application integrates several subsystems to deliver fan control functionality:
- **GUI Interface & Tray Icon:** Built using GTK+ 3 and libayatana-appindicator3-0.1.
- **Hardware Communication:** Utilizes hidapi to interact with Thermaltake Riing Quad controllers.
- **GPU Monitoring:** Relies on nvidia-ml to retrieve Nvidia GPU temperature data.
- **Rendering:** Employs Vulkan for graphical output.
- **Modern C++ Design:** Leverages C++23 features along with design patterns such as Mediator, Observer, and Strategy to ensure a modular and maintainable architecture.

> **Note:** This project is labeled as experimental ("Unstable & Nvidia only"). Use it at your own risk, and be aware that stability or compatibility may vary depending on your setup.

## Hardware Limitations

- **Supported Controllers:** Only Thermaltake Riing Quad controllers are supported.
- **GPU Requirement:** Nvidia GPUs only (due to reliance on nvidia-ml for GPU monitoring).
- **Operating System:** Designed for Linux systems that support GTK+ 3, Vulkan, and the other listed dependencies.

## Dependencies

To build and run this project, ensure that the following dependencies are installed on your system:

- **GTK+ 3:** For creating the graphical user interface and managing the system tray.
- **libayatana-appindicator3-0.1:** Provides tray icon support.
- **hidapi:** For interfacing with Human Interface Devices (HID).
- **nvidia-ml:** Used to monitor Nvidia GPU temperatures.
- **Vulkan:** Required for rendering within the application.
- **C++23:** The codebase leverages modern C++ features.
- **cmake:** For configuring the build system.

## Building the Application

Follow these steps to compile the project:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/At1ass/tt_riing_quad_fan_control.git
   cd tt_riing_quad_fan_control
2. **Create and navigate to a build directory:**

   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
3. **Run CMake to configure the project:**

   ```bash
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
   ```
4. **Compile the project using Make:**

   ```bash
   make -j$(nproc)
   ```
## Installing the Application

After a successful build, you can install the application system-wide:

   ```bash
   make install
   ```

This command will:

- Install the executable to the system's `bin` directory (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`).
- Install additional files like `LICENSE` and `README.md` to `share/tt_riing_quad_fan_control`.

## Running the Application

After installing, you can run the application directly:

   ```bash
   tt_riing_quad_fan_control
   ```

Or, if running from the build directory without installation:

   ```bash
   ./tt_riing_quad_fan_control
   ```

## Uninstalling the Application

An uninstall target has been provided to remove all installed files. This target uses an uninstall script generated by CMake. To uninstall, simply run:

   ```bash
   make uninstall
   ```

>**Note**: The uninstall script reads the `install_manifest.txt` file generated during installation and removes all files listed there. Ensure that you have run `make install` before attempting to uninstall.

## Configuration

The application expects a configuration file located at `$HOME/.config/config2.toml`. When this file is absent, the program will initialize using default dummy fan settings. You can modify this file to adjust fan behavior according to your system's requirements.
